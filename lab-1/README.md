# Lab 1 — JavaScript Conditionals & Loops

This collection includes eight concise JavaScript exercises that demonstrate conditionals and loops. Each exercise is provided as its own script in the `js/` directory.

## Running the exercises
- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- In `index.html` there are multiple `<script>` tags; enable only one exercise at a time by uncommenting the desired `<script>` and commenting out the others.
- After switching which script is active, refresh the page to run that exercise.

## Interaction & output
- Exercises use `alert()` and `prompt()` for user input and basic interaction.
- Exercises that illustrate looping print results to the browser console with `console.log()`.
